Graph Traversal and Shortest Path Algorithm This project implements graph traversal algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). Additionally, it includes Dijkstra’s algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. It’s a C++ project designed to demonstrate fundamental graph data structure manipulation and traversal techniques.
